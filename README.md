Presentation template and tips
==============================
# Beamer template
The zipped [file](./Beamer_template.zip) contains a beamer template which can be used to make presentation. My students and I have been using this a lot. One of the features of this template is that, it allows you to cite references in the beamer slide itself, rather than listing them at the end of the presentation. 

# Presentation tips
The [file](./Presentation_tips.pdf) contains some tips you can keep in mind while making a presentation. This was used for a course I taught a while ago at IIT Madras.
